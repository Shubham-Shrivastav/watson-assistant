# Building actions from a template
{: #actions-templates}

When creating actions, you can choose a template that relates to the problem youâ€™re trying to solve. Templates help tailor your actions to include items specific to your business need. The examples in each template can also help you to learn how actions work.
{: shortdesc}

Templates are available for different use cases, for example, booking a meeting, connecting to a live agent, or creating a support ticket. Each template includes all the pieces that make up a complete action, such as steps, conditions, and different response types to collect customer answers.

Some or all of these features are included as examples in action templates:

| Feature | Description | More information |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Step conditions | A step condition is a boolean test, based on a runtime value. The step executes only if the test evaluates as true. | [Adding conditions to a step](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-step-conditions) |
| Options synonyms | Synonyms are variations of an option value that customers might enter. | [Options](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-collect-info#customer-response-type-options) |
| Customized response validation | When you edit a step that expects a customer response, you can customize how validation errors are handled. | [When your customer gives invalid answers](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-handle-errors#step-validation)
| Variables to reuse customer answers | When customers reply to your assistant, they share information about themselves and what they want. Your assistant remembers this information, and other information about a conversation, as variables. | [Using variables to manage conversation information](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-manage-info) |
| Regex response type | A regex response collects a text string that matches a pattern expressed as a regular expression. Use this response to capture a value that must conform to a particular pattern or format, such as an email address or telephone number. | [Regex](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-collect-info#customer-response-type-regex) |
 | Yes/No response type | A confirmation response presents customers with the choices of either Yes or No as clickable buttons. | [Confirmation](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-collect-info#customer-response-type-confirmation) |

You can create multiple actions from the same template. For example, if you have already used the **Book a meeting** template to create an action, you can choose that template again. If the first action is still named **Book a meeting**, the new action is added with the name **Book a meeting (1)**.
