# Backing up and restoring data
{: #admin-backup-restore}

{: shortdesc}

You can download the following data from a {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service instance:

- Actions

You cannot download the following data:

- Search
- Assistant, including any configured integrations

## Retaining logs
{: #backup-retain-logs}

If you want to store logs of conversations that users have had with your assistant, you can use the `/logs` API to export your log data. See [API reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v1#listlogs){: external} for details.

Logs are stored for a different amount of time depending on your service plan. For example, Lite plans provide logs from the past 7 days only. See [Log limits](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-logs#logs-limits){: external} for more information.

## Downloading
{: #backup-restore-export}

To back up actions, download a JSON file and store it.

1. On the **Actions** page, click **Global settings** ![Gear icon](images/gear-icon-black.png).

1. On the **Upload/Download** tab, click the **Download** button.

## Uploading
{: #backup-restore-import}

To reinstate a backup copy of actions that you exported from another service instance or environment, import the JSON file of the actions you exported.

If the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service changes between the time you export the actions and import it, due to functional updates that are regularly applied to instances in cloud-hosted continuous delivery environments, your imported actions might function differently than before.
{: important}

1. On the **Actions** page, click **Global settings** ![Gear icon](images/gear-icon-black.png).

1. On the **Upload/Download** tab, drag and drop a JSON file onto the tab or click to select a file from your local system, then click **Upload**.

    The imported JSON file must use UTF-8 encoding, without byte order mark (BOM) encoding. The JSON file cannot contain tabs, newlines, or carriage returns.
