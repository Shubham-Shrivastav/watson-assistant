# Securing the web chat
{: #web-chat-security}

You can configure the web chat to authenticate users and protect private data.
{: shortdesc}

All messages that are sent between the web chat and the assistant are encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). However, there are additional steps you can take to further secure the web chat.

- You can [digitally sign messages](#web-chat-security-task) from the web chat to ensure that they originate from your website. If you enable web chat security, all messages are authenticated using a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed with an RSA private key.

- You can [prevent unauthorized access](#web-chat-security-encrypt) to sensitive customer information. With web chat security enabled, you can use a public key to encrypt sensitive information as part of the JWT payload. This information is stored only in private variables, which cannot be seen by customers and are never included in logs.

- You can [authenticate users](#web-chat-security-authenticate) by user ID, enabling your assistant to control access to functions that require authorization.

## Before you begin
{: #web-chat-security-prereq}

Before you enable security, complete the following steps:

1. Create a RS256 private/public key pair. You can use a tool such as OpenSSL or PuTTYgen.

    For example, to create the key pair at a command prompt using OpenSSL, you would use the command `openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048`.

1. Use the private key to sign a JSON Web Token (JWT). You will use this token to sign messages that are sent from your website as proof of their origin.

    The JWT payload must specify the following claims:

    - `iss`: The issuer of the JWT. This value is a case-sensitive string.

    - `sub`: The principal that is the subject of the JWT. This value must either be scoped to be locally unique in the context of the issuer or be globally unique.
    
        The value you specify for `sub` is used as the user ID for messages signed with this token, which can affect billing. (For more information about user-based billing, see [User-based plans explained](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-managing-plan#admin-managing-plan-user-based)).

        This same user ID is also used as the customer ID, which can be used to make requests to delete user data. Because the ID is sent in an HTTP header field, the syntax must meet the requirements for header fields as defined in [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2){: external} (all visible ASCII characters).
        
        For more information about deleting user data, see [Labeling and deleting data](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-securing#securing-gdpr-wa).

    - `exp`: The expiration time on or after which the JWT cannot be accepted for processing. Many libraries set this value for you automatically. Set a short-lived `exp` claim with whatever library you use.

    Most programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. The following NodeJS code sample illustrates how to generate a JWT token.

    ```javascript
    // Sample NodeJS code on your server.
    const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

    /**
     * Returns a signed JWT generated by RS256 algorithm.
     */
    function mockLogin() {
        const payload = {
            /*
             * Even if this is an unauthenticated user, add a userID in the sub claim that can be used
             * for billing purposes.
             * This ID will help us keep track "unique users". For unauthenticated users, drop a
             * cookie in the browser so you can make sure the user is counted uniquely across visits.
             */
            sub: 'some-user-id', // Required
            iss: 'yourdomain.com' // Required
        };
        // The "expiresIn" option adds an "exp" claim to the payload.
        return jwt.sign(payload, process.env.YOUR_PRIVATE_RSA_KEY, { algorithm: 'RS256', expiresIn: '10000ms' });
    }
    ```
    {: codeblock}

For more information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [RFC7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519){: external} and [OpenID Connect 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html){: external} specifications.

## Enable security
{: #web-chat-security-task}

Now that you have generated your JWT, you can enable web chat security.

Enabling web chat security disables the shareable preview link. For more information about the preview link, see [Copying a link to share](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-preview-share#preview-share-link).
{: important}

To enable security, complete the following steps:

1. From the **Security** tab of the web chat integration settings, set the **Secure your web chat** switch to **On**.

1. In the **Your public key** field, paste your public key.

    {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} uses the public key to verify that incoming messages originate from your website. Any messages that are not signed with the proper private key are rejected.

1. In your website HTML, update the web chat embed script to specify the JWT you generated. This token is used to sign each message sent from your website.

    1. Specify the token in the [`identityToken`](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configuration#optionsidentitytoken){: external} property of the options object.

        ```html
        <script>
          window.watsonAssistantChatOptions = {
              integrationID: 'YOUR_INTEGRATION_ID',
              region: 'YOUR_REGION',
              serviceInstanceID: 'YOUR_SERVICE_INSTANCE',
              identityToken: 'YOUR_JWT',
              onLoad: function(instance) {
                instance.render();
                }
            };
          setTimeout(function(){
            const t=document.createElement('script');
            t.src="https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.appdomain.cloud/loadWatsonAssistantChat.js";
            document.head.appendChild(t);
          });
        </script>
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        Starting with web chat version 3.2.0, this step is optional. Instead, you can complete the next step to provide the token using the `identityTokenExpired` event handler.
        {: tip}

    1. In your `onLoad` event handler, use the [`on()`](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methods#on){: external} instance method to subscribe to the `identityTokenExpired` event. This event is fired in the following situations:
    
    - When the web chat opens, if no JWT was provided using the `identityToken` configuration option (web chat 3.2.0 and later only).
    - When the JWT expires.

    Use the event callback to provide a new token and to process any messages that were queued for processing during the time the token was expired:

    ```html
    <script>
    window.watsonAssistantChatOptions = {
      integrationID: 'YOUR_INTEGRATION_ID',
      region: 'YOUR_REGION',
      serviceInstanceID: 'YOUR_SERVICE_INSTANCE',
      identityToken: 'YOUR_JWT',
      onLoad: function(instance) {
        instance.on({ type: 'identityTokenExpired', handler: function(event) {
          // Perform whatever actions you need to take on your system to get a new token.
          return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
            // And then pass the new JWT into the callback and the service will resume processing messages.
            event.identityToken = 'YOUR NEW JWT';
            resolve();
          });
        }});
        instance.render();
      }
    };
    setTimeout(function(){
        const t=document.createElement('script');
        t.src="https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.appdomain.cloud/loadWatsonAssistantChat.js";
        document.head.appendChild(t);
      });
    </script>
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    This step is required if you did not specify the JWT using the `identityToken` configuration option in the previuos step.
    {: tip}

    The JWT you specify is automatically used to sign each subsequent message that is sent from the web chat instance on your web site, until it expires.

### Passing sensitive data
{: #web-chat-security-encrypt}

You can optionally copy the public key that is provided by IBM, and use it to add an additional level of encryption to support passing sensitive data from the web chat.

Use this method to send sensitive information in messages that come from your website, such as a information about a customer's loyalty level, a user ID, or security tokens to use in webhooks that you call from your actions. Information that is passed to your assistant in this way is stored in a private variable in your assistant. Private variables cannot be seen by customers and are never sent back to the web chat.

For example, you might start a business process for a VIP customer that is different from the process you start for less important customers. You likely do not want non-VIPs to know that they are categorized as such. But you must pass this information to your action because it changes the route of the conversation. You can pass the customer MVP status as an encrypted variable. This private context variable will be available for use by the action, but not by anything else.

1.  From the web chat configuration page, copy the public key from the **IBM provided public key** field.
1.  From your website, write a function that signs a JSON Web Token.

    For example, the following NodeJS code snippet shows a function that accepts a userID and payload content and sends it to the web chat. If a payload is provided, its content is encrypted and signed with the IBM public key.

    ```javascript

    // Sample NodeJS code on your server.
    const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
    const RSA = require('node-rsa');

    const rsaKey = new RSA(process.env.PUBLIC_IBM_RSA_KEY);

    /**
    * Returns a signed JWT. Optionally, also adds an encrypted user_payload.
    * The userPayload is stringified JSON.
    */
    function mockLogin(userID, userPayload) {
    const payload = {
      sub: userID, // Required
      // The exp claim is automatically added by the jsonwebtoken library.
      // We recommend you set a short lived exp claim
      // with whatever library you are using.
    };
    if (userPayload) {
        // If there is a user payload we encrypt it using the IBM public key.
        // Should be encrypted to base64 format.
        payload.user_payload = rsaKey.encrypt(userPayload, 'base64');
    }
    const token = jwt.sign(payload, process.env.YOUR_PRIVATE_RSA_KEY, { algorithm: 'RS256', expiresIn: '10000ms' });
    return token;
    }
    ```
    {: codeblock}

1. The encrypted user payload is decrypted and then saved to the `context.integrations.chat.private.user_payload` object.

    You might want to access the payload, for example, to get the customer importance information or single sign-on credentials that you can subsequently use to authenticate a webhook.

### Authenticating users
{: #web-chat-security-authenticate}

To authenticate and specify a unique ID for each customer, add the user ID information to the token.

1.  From the web chat configuration page, copy the public key from the **IBM provided public key** field. You will specify this value as the `PUBLIC_IBM_RSA_KEY` later.
1.  From your website, write a function that signs a JSON Web Token.

    The function must accept a UserID parameter and set the userID as the `sub` claim value.

    For example, the following NodeJS code snippet set the user's ID to `L12345`.

    ```javascript
    // Sample NodeJS code on your server.
    const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
    const RSA = require('node-rsa');

    const rsaKey = new RSA(process.env.PUBLIC_IBM_RSA_KEY);

    /**
    * Returns a signed JWT. Optionally, adds an encrypted user payload in stringified JSON.
    */
    function mockLogin() {
      const payload = {
        sub: 'L12345', // Required
        iss: 'www.example.com' // Required
      };
      const token = jwt.sign(payload, process.env.YOUR_PRIVATE_RSA_KEY, { algorithm: 'RS256', expiresIn: '10000ms' });
    return token;
    }
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    After you set the value of the `sub` claim to be the user's userID, you cannot change the claim to another user. The userID that you specify with this method is used for billing purposes and can be used to delete customer data upon request.

    The userID is stored in the context object as `context.global.system.user_id`.

    The user ID that is specified in the `sub` claim is also sent in the `customer_id` section of the `X-Watson-Metadata` HTTP header. The `customer_id` can be used to make requests to delete user data. Because the ID is sent in a header field, the syntax must meet the requirements for header fields as defined in [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2){: external} (all visible ASCII characters).
    <!--- For more information about deleting user data, see [Labeling and deleting data](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-information-security#information-security-gdpr-wa){: external}. --->

If you disable security, then you can use the `instance.updateUserID()` method to specify user IDs. For more information, see [Managing user identity information](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-userid).

## Logging out
{: #web-chat-security-logout}

To log out a customer, you must destroy the web chat.

If you reload the page when a customer logs out, you must call the `instance.destroySession()` method to remove any reference to the current session from the browser's cookies and storage. If you forget to call this method, information that is protected by the `identityToken` is not at risk, but the web chat will try to connect to the previous session and fail.

If you do not perform a full page reload when a customer logs out, call the `instance.destroy()` method. The `destroy` method removes the current instance of the web chat that is configured for the current userID from the DOM and browser memory. Next, call the `instance.destroySession()` method.

## Updating site security policies
{: #web-chat-security-csp}

If your website uses a Content Security Policy (CSP), you must update it to grant permission to the web chat.

The following table lists the values to add to your CSP.

| Property | Additional values |
|----------|-------------------|
| default-src	| 'self' *.watson.appdomain.cloud fonts.gstatic.com 'unsafe-inline' |
| connect-src |	*.watsonplatform.net *.watson.appdomain.cloud |
{: caption="CSP properties" caption-side="top"}

The following example shows a complete CSP metadata tag:

```html
<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="default-src 'self' *.watson.appdomain.cloud fonts.gstatic.com 'unsafe-inline';connect-src *.watsonplatform.net *.watson.appdomain.cloud" />
```
{: codeblock}

### Allowing elements
{: #web-chat-security-allow-elements}

If your CSP uses a nonce to add elements, such as `<script>` and `<style>` tags, to an allowlist, do not use `unsafe-inline` to allow all such elements. Instead, provide a nonce value to the web chat widget as a configuration option. The web chat will then set the nonce on any of the `<script>` and `<style>` elements that it generates dynamically.

A CSP that passes a nonce to the web chat widget might look like this:

<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="default-src 'self' *.watson.appdomain.cloud fonts.gstatic.com 'nonce-<server generated value>';connect-src *.watsonplatform.net *.watson.appdomain.cloud"
>

You can pass the nonce to the web chat by editing the embed script as follows:

```javascript
window.watsonAssistantChatOptions = {
  integrationID: "YOUR_INTEGRATION_ID",
  region: "YOUR_REGION",
  serviceInstanceID: "YOUR_SERVICE_INSTANCE",

  cspNonce: "<server generated value>",

  onLoad: function(instance) {
    instance.render();
  }
};
```
{: codeblock}

## Security measures
{: #web-chat-security-measures}

The web chat integration undergoes tests and scans on a regular basis to find and address potential security issues, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

Be sure to run your own security reviews to see how the web chat fits in with your current website structure and policies. The web chat is hosted on your site and can inherit any vulnerabilities that your site has. Only serve content over HTTPS, use Content Security Policy (CSP), and implement other basic web security precautions.


## Not sure what to do with this

The web chat uses an RSA signature with SHA-256 (RS256) to encrypt communication. RS256 signatures use a sophisticated type of RSA encryption. An RSA key pair includes a private and a public key. The RSA private key is used to generate digital signatures, and the RSA public key is used to verify digital signatures. The complexity of the RSA algorithm that is used to scramble the message makes it nearly impossible to unscramble the message without the key.

The following diagram illustrates the requests that are sent back and forth to authenticate a request.
