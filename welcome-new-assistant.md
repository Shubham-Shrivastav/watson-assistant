# Welcome to the new {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}
{: #welcome-new-assistant}

Welcome to the documentation for the new {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}!
{: shortdesc}

The new {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} experience, focused on using **actions** to build customer conversations, is designed to make it simple enough for *anyone* to build a virtual assistant. Building, testing, publishing, and analyzing your assistant can all now be done in one simple and intuitive interface.

- New **navigation** provides a workflow for building, previewing, publishing, and analyzing your assistant. 

- Each assistant has a **home page** with a task list to help you get started.

- Build conversations with **actions**, which represent the tasks you want your assistant to help your customers with. Each action contains a series of steps that represent individual exchanges with a customer.

- A new way to **publish** lets you review and debug your work in a draft environment before going live to your customers.

- Use a new suite of **analytics** to improve your assistant. Review which actions are being completed to see what your customers want help with, determine if your assistant understands and addresses customer needs, and decide how can you make your assistant better.

- Explore our [interactive demo site](https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-assistant/demos/lendyr/demo.html){:external} to learn how {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}
 can be used to build powerful, scalable experiences for your users.
