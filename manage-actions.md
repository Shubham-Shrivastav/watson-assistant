Use different {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} capabilities to manage your actions workflow within a single assistant and between multiple assistants.

| Task | You can |
| --- | --- |
| [Duplicating an action](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-duplicate-action) | Duplicate an action to reuse information in a new action. When you duplicate an action, the new action includes everything except example phrases. |
| [Copying an action to another assistant](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-copy-action) | Copy an action from one assistant to another. When you copy an action, references to other actions, variables, and saved responses are also copied. |

| [Organizing actions in collections](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-collections) | Use a collection to organize your actions. You can put actions into folder-style groups based on whatever categorization you need at your organization, such as by use case, internal team, or status. |
